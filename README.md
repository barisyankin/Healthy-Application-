# Healthy-Application-
HealthyApp covers many different areas including nutrition, exercise, weight loss, and options. 
I developed a platform for fitness trainers to communicate better with people who want to do sports with Information Technologies. I will frequently encounter examples of the beginning and development of a new technological age in health and sports in the coming days. One of our main goals is to encourage people to do sports. Not to limit them and to offer a platform that they can easily choose, be convinced and feel comfortable, instead of walking around the gym in front of them. I think that interacting with one-on-one fitness trainers, seeing many options and making time arrangements, will encourage users to use the application by providing a place where they can relax. Finally, I want to offer a unique experience to our users with application usage, effectiveness and usefulness.
